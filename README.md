# FWC - Fucking Working Calculator

FWC, or Fucking Working Calculator, is a robust calculator designed to handle complex mathematical expressions that standard web calculators struggle with. The inspiration for FWC came from encountering various web tools that fail to process higher numbers accurately, especially with operations like modulo. Unlike these tools, FWC is built to handle large numbers and complex expressions seamlessly.

## Project Status

This project is currently in development and not yet hosted. The core functionality, which includes a custom interpreter for function terms, is implemented in Go. We aim to further enhance its capabilities by implementing improvement algorithms when time permits. Despite the recent inactivity in commits, the project is actively maintained and is not abandoned.

## Features

- **Robust Expression Handling:** Accepts and accurately calculates complex expressions that are difficult to manage on standard calculators.
- **Custom Interpreter:** Features a self-written interpreter that efficiently parses and executes function terms.
- **High Number Capability:** Specially designed to work with high numbers, particularly in operations where other calculators fail.

## Usage

FWC is straightforward to use. Simply input your mathematical expression, and FWC will handle the rest. More detailed usage instructions will be available once the project is fully operational on the web.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Whether it's feature requests, bug reports, or code contributions, please feel free to make an issue or pull request on this repository. Your input helps make FWC even better.

## Future Plans

- Implement additional algorithms for performance enhancement.
- Deploy FWC on a web platform to be easily accessible to everyone.

Stay tuned for updates, and thank you for checking out FWC - a calculator that actually works!
