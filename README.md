# Fucking Working Calculator

This is just a regular Calculator which supports basic funcionality that should be provided by the big names (GeoGebra, etc) but isn't.
Depending on the size I am aiming for (note that this is a side project) this will have trivial arithmetic functions.

## Wanted features
- Take in a Mathematical Term and be able to calculate it (without variables)
    - +,-,\*,/,mod,^,(,)
